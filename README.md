# Classification_algo
An efficient implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for a 4 feature 1 class label dataset with binary classification. Objective was for the code to show underfitting and overfitting when trained with different proportions of the data. 

The source code in src compares Gaussin Naiive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers for a dataset with 4 features and 1 class label performing binary classification. 
The code uses vectorization and broadcasting where possible to speed up the algorithms and uses gradient descent for weight optimzation in the case of Logistic Regression. 

The code trains the classifiers with different proportions of the total data to show underfitting and overfitting and biased predictions.
